are applicable across industries. We understand that no matter the
industry or the service offered by your organisation, the customer is
the most valuable asset.

With proper implementation of CRM, we ensure you are equipped to work
with them. CRM implementation is the most discussed and planned process
with our clients. Your input and collaboration determine the difference
between the success and failure of the project.

CRM is unquestionably useful in the process of managing a better
relationship with your customers. Easily customised and implemented,
CRM, in the long run, could even help you save money and increase your
margins.

\

CRM is also useful for smaller businesses. We can help you design a
customised scalable CRM to ensure that your whole team follows the right
process, independently without monitoring.

\

We customise CRM based on the requirements and the leads of our clients
so that they can give the right attention to their customers. We help
them track the lead, right from generation to conversion – thus
analysing the marketing campaign’s effectiveness.

\

This understanding and analysis of the sales and marketing process would
help you to automate your recurring day-to-day work with the right tools
and training. In time, every one of your business processes could be
automated with simple or sophisticated approval processes based on your
business needs.

\

Sales force automation in CRM can give your sales reps the power of
automation and artificial intelligence. Automate enquiries to the right
agent or group for quick and accurate case resolutions.

\

Hundreds of repetitive and time-consuming tasks can be automated to be
handled, allowing you to focus your resources on closing leads and
attending to customer pain points.

\

Use real-time data from across your multiple business workflows, with
advanced reporting and multiple filters to access the right information
on your configurable dashboards to make consistent and informed
decisions.

Customer relationship management software can be used for collecting,
organising, and managing the customer information. It can be even
combined with other software applications used by the company for
automation to save time, increase revenue, and most importantly improve
customer service.

Marketing, Sales, and Support are often seen as different teams and
hence tend to operate separately. Yet, they are different faces of one
team, your team. With the support of CRM software, you may actually make
them work as a clan.

This integration through CRM software creates opportunities for the
Sales and Marketing teams to understand the role they play in the
organisation’s workflow. By tailoring data-driven automated marketing
campaigns, we could speed up the sales pipeline while generating new
leads.

With the power of the cloud, integrating different apps is not only
possible, it is also a practical way to strengthen your brand. We are
the team to deliver CRM tools that work with ERP as well as Accounting
tools that integrate together, resolving the biggest challenge for
enterprises which try to move to the cloud.

\

Your management can run the business even on their mobile devices
through CRM Data and productivity tools to collaborate with the team, to
handle service enquiries and even close deals without data connectivity
- the apps could automatically sync whenever they got back online.

\

Task Management and Activity Feed gives you a complete view of all the
engagement with your customers from one spot. Other features include the
ability to make and receive calls from a pop-up that provides all the
information and interaction history at one glance, without having to
shift windows or screens. \

Your customers are spread out in terms of geography and demography – and
it is expected of you as a brand to be everywhere your customer would
want you to be. This is achieved only through cloud-based CRM apps to
communicate and collect data through multiple channels.

\

Small businesses (like us) usually operate with a limited budget and a
system where data is systematically collected from emails, calendars,
and even phone calls. This data is automatically stored, and can easily
be accessed from any device with an internet connection, saving time and
money.

**Customer Data Collection** {#zoom .ex2 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 30px;font-family: Roboto;color: #00a8c5"}
----------------------------

![](img\CRM\bg2.jpg)

The CRM process involves collecting and organising actionable customer
data. This is a must for any business that plans to improve their
customer satisfaction to the next levels.

\

The available CRM features enable you to collect and understand your
customers better by gathering data to build better marketing, sales and
service process.

\

With multiple users accessing the data, the CRM software allows you to
manage the read and write permissions for different user profiles. This
gives you control to see who gets to view and access specific data
depending upon hierarchy. Data storage and file storage are given to the
users individually, apart from organisation data storage.

\

Social CRM enables you to find new prospects and leads on major social
media. You could view your customer’s profiles or even follow their
posts to understand how the software could be used to enable them.
Social CRM also helps you stay connected directly with your customers
across social networks by responding wherever they talk about your
brand.

\

**Customer Data Management** {#zoom .ex2 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 30px;font-family: Roboto;color: #00a8c5"}
----------------------------

Once the CRM system is set in place, the updated data can be used by
your brand to understand how it is consumed by your customers. With this
information about your products and services, you will be able to grow
your brand to meet the requirements and needs of your customer by
maximising customer interactions. Taking swift decisions and
prioritising tasks can be made based on real-time data, which is made
available at one place, and on any device.

Using the CRM software, your sales representatives will be enabled to
create targeted lists of emails to be targeted during events to send the
right promotional material to the right potential customer.

The sales representatives have easy and swift access to both the sales
materials as well as the complete view of the customers in the CRM
software. This gives them the opportunity to easily identify their
requirements and upsell to provide immediate support as and when
required.

Providing sales and support through multiple channels has become the
accepted norm across many of the verticals that we use today. It is
expected of a brand to deliver on-demand support anytime through media
such as Social Media, Live Chat, Phone calls, SMSes, and Email. This can
only be achieved with a highly customised, automated and user-friendly
CRM software.

\

When a customer contacts your organisation, representatives will be able
to retrieve all activity using CRM services. This could include all the
activity concerning past purchases, preferences, and anything else that
might assist them in finding a solution. With convenient and quick
access to customer files on the cloud, anyone handling customer support
will be able to have actionable data instantly available to help them.

**Process & Tracking** {#zoom .ex2 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 30px;font-family: Roboto;color: #00a8c5"}
----------------------

\

![CRM](img\CRM\4.jpg)

Users generate a lot of data when they use products and services.
Tracking all of this humungous amounts of data about how the user
interacts with the brand in one place, is the next big thing in
gathering information.

Custom CRM software can be used for tracking every interaction and
action that your organization takes. It will then needs to be
identified, documented, and recorded. To do this, we help you to move
beyond traditional, clumsy sticky-notes and disorganized filing cabinets
and start embracing technology.

![](img\CRM\bg2.jpg)

Sales can be tracked by analysing what is in the pipeline and
forecasting win-loss analysis. The results could be available in
real-time on the dashboard of any of your devices.

\

Manage your brand’s leads, assigning routes to the right sales
representatives automatically. This rules-based lead scoring system can
be customised with the help of a preset set of rules as decided by the
management ensuring a smooth transition from lead to conversion. Apart
from preventing duplication of entries, this ensures that the data is
reliable, usable and relevant for the sales representatives to act upon.

\

Easily process contracts, orders, products, and quotes that your teams
are handling. Firmly process and determine approvals in a preset manner,
automating notifications to the management. This process is more
efficient with the management manually approving such transactions
before sending to the customer.

**In Conclusion** {#zoom .ex2 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 30px;font-family: Roboto;color: #00a8c5"}
-----------------

![](img\CRM\bg2.jpg)

The aim of a customer relationship management system is to help brands
manage and process existing customers in an effective manner while
pursuing potential customers spending lesser time and closing more
trades. CRM development is useful as a well customised CRM gives you the
right tools to process more customers, closing more deals and
accelerating sales productivity.

\

And we do not just provide the tools and disappear. We give you value
for money in terms of training and offer one-on-one support on demand
for all our clients, before and after the implementation.
